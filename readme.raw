The RAW folder is where included services will store raw data to be
processed by (and eventually removed by) these services. It SHOULD
NOT be archived.  It SHOULD NOT be subject to version control. It
MUST NOT be removed. This is similar to the ACC folder which is
included as well for backwards compatability.
